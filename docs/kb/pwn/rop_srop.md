# ROP / SROP

**ROP** stands for return oriented programming. In this attack, you force values on the stack and
take advantage of a `ret` instruction to jump where you want.

**SROP** stands for sigreturn oriented programming. SROP needs a bit more conditions to be met, but
it allows among other things to set all the registers to the values you want.
